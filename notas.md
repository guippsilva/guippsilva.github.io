Axiom 2.1. 0 is a natural number.<br>
Axiom 2.2. If n is a natural number, then n ++ is also a natural number.<br>
Axiom 2.3. 0 is not the successor of any natural number; i.e., we have n ++ ≠ 0 for every natural number n.<br>
Axiom 2.4. Different natural numbers must have different successors; i.e., if n, m are natural numbers and n ≠ m, then n ++ ≠ m ++. Equivalently, if n ++ = m ++, then we must have n = m.<br>
Axiom 2.5 (Principle of mathematical induction). Let P(n) be any property pertaining to a natural number n. Suppose that P(0) is true, and suppose that whenever P(n) is true, P(n ++) is also true. Then P(n) is true for every natural number n.

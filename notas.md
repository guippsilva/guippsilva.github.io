Axiom 2.1. 0 is a natural number.
  
Axiom 2.2. If n is a natural number, then n ++ is also a natural number.

Axiom 2.3. 0 is not the successor of any natural number; i.e., we have
n ++ 6= 0 for every natural number n.

Axiom 2.4. Different natural numbers must have different successors; i.e.,
if n, m are natural numbers and n 6= m, then n ++ 6= m ++. Equivalently,
if n ++ = m ++, then we must have n = m.

Axiom 2.5 (Principle of mathematical induction). Let P(n) be any property pertaining to a natural number n. Suppose that P(0) is true, and
suppose that whenever P(n) is true, P(n ++) is also true. Then P(n) is
true for every natural number n.
